# LTEV2Vsim

******
We are uploading the new release of the simulator, including 5G-V2X

It will be with a new name at this link: https://github.com/V2Xgithub/WiLabV2Xsim

Since, despite the new name it is more an upgrade than a new simulator, we will start with Version 6.1
******

LTEV2Vsim is a dynamic simulator, written in MATLAB, designed for the investigation of resource allocation in LTE-V2V networks, with focus on the cooperative awareness service. Since version 3.0, LTEV2Vsim also allows to simulate the cooperative awareness service using IEEE 802.11p/ITS-G5.

The simulator is shared under the GNU GPLv3.

The software has been developed and shared by University of Bologna, CNR, and CNIT - Italy. A web page was set up at http://www.wcsg.ieiit.cnr.it/products/LTEV2Vsim.html (since January 2020, download of code and files from there are not available - information inside that page might also not be always up-to-date)

Before version 5.0, the simulator was based on a "beacon period" timing, which was a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Starting from version 5.0, the time granularity has been reduced to 1 ms in order to allow simulating more cases, including traffic generation with non-uniform-periodic characteristics. Additionaly, whereas before version 5.0 there were two separate main files for LTE-V2X and IEEE 802.11p, since verison 5.0 there is a single main, allowing simulating both technologies at the same time.
Version 5.4 (uploaded in October 2020) comes with a number of improvements related to both sidelink LTE-V2X and IEEE 802.11p. For details, please refer to the read-me document which is available within the compressed file.
In the case you wish to use traffic traces for the vehicle positions, you are kindly suggested to use version 5.4.

NOTICE: at least MATLAB R2016b is required.

The structure and features of the simulator, along with its main inputs and outputs, are described in
